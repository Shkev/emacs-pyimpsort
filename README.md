[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/emacs-pe/impsort.el.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emacs-pe/impsort.el)

`impsort.el` sort the python imports of a file.
Currently uses [impsort.py](impsort.py) to process the way to sort python
imports.

### Setup

Add the following snippet to your `init.el`:

    (require 'impsort)
    (eval-after-load 'python
      '(define-key python-mode-map "\C-c\C-u" #'impsort-buffer))

### Troubleshooting

+ **Doesn't sort correcly third party libraries**

  `impsort.el` tries to identify the third party libraries if are installed
  in in the PYTHONPATH, if a package is not installed it is assumed that
  belongs to the application.
  `impsort.el` also tries to identify if a python virtualenv
  is activated.
